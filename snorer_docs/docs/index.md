# What is `snorer` about?

`snorer`, stands for  *S*upernova-*N*eutrino-b*O*osted da*R*k matt*ER*, is a package for evaluating time-of-flight signatures of supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$ BDM) from our Milky Way, SN1987a in Large Magellanic Cloud and SN in arbitrary distant galaxy.

## Installation

To install, excute the following command on the prompt:

    $ pip install snorer

and everything should be processed on-the-fly.

### Prerequisites

`snorer` requires python >= 3.8 and the following dependencies:

- `numpy` >= 1.20
- `scipy` >= 1.10
- `vegas` >= 6.0
- `astropy` >= 6.0
- `emcee` >= 3.1

where `vegas` is a the backend engine for evaluating multidimensional integrals based on adaptive Monte Carlo vegas algorithm, see [https://pypi.org/project/vegas](https://pypi.org/project/vega) for detail.
Other dependencies may be required by these packages and will be installed as well.

## Getting started

`snorer` can be imported like any other packages
```python
import snorer    # Import snorer functions
```
Assuming the following locations:

- Distance between Earth and galactic center (GC): $R_e=8.5$ kpc
- Distance between Earth and SN: $R_s=8.5$ kpc
- The angle $\beta=0$

and DM properties:

- Mass $m_\chi=0.001$ MeV
- Kinetic energy $T_\chi=15$ MeV

### Evaluating flux
Suppose we want to evaluate the BDM flux at $t=100$ seconds after the observation of SN$\nu$, then

```python
# Collecting parameters
t,Tx,mx,Rstar,beta = 100,15,1e-2,8.5,0
# Evaluating flux, 1/MeV/cm^2/s
flux = snorer.flux(t,Tx,mx,Rstar,beta,is_spike=True,neval=15000)
print(flux)
```
```python
4.572295175982701e-16
```

The arguments `is_spike` determines whether DM spike in the central region of the halo is considered and `neval` dictates how many samples will be generated by `vegas` in each chain.

### Evaluating event
